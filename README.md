# MoodMatcher 
MoodMatcher is a web app that analyzes your mood and recommends a movie based on how you feel. It uses a Node.js/Express backend, a modern HTML/CSS/JS frontend, and integrates with Groq and Firebase for authentication and AI-powered recommendations.
- Maintainer: [Sarah Kazi](https://github.com/Sarah-Kazi)

## Features

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sarah-kazi/mood_movie.git
    cd mood_movie
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example file:
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open the `.env` file and add your secret keys and configuration values. You will need API keys/credentials for:
    -   Groq API
    -   Firebase (for authentication)
    -   YouTube Data API
    -   TMDB API (for movie posters)

    ```dotenv
    # .env
    GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key-here
    
    FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
    FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=your_firebase_private_key_id
    FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYour private key here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
    FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_firebase_client_email
    FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID=your_firebase_client_id
    # ... other Firebase variables from .env.example
    
    YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key_here
    TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
    
    PORT=3000
    ```
    Create a `firebaseconfig.js` file in the public directory by copying the below format:
    ```js
    // Replace with your own Firebase config
     const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "",
       authDomain: "",
       projectId: "",
       storageBucket: "",
       messagingSenderId: "",
       appId: "",
       measurementId: ""
     };
     export default firebaseConfig;
    ```

### Running the Application

You have a few options to run the server, based on the scripts in `package.json`:

-   **Demo Mode (No API Keys Required):**
    This script runs a demo version of the application.
    ```sh
    npm run quick
    ```

-   **Development Mode:**
    This command starts the server using `nodemon`, which will automatically restart the server whenever you make changes to the code.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

-   **Production Mode:**
    This command starts the server in a standard way.
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
